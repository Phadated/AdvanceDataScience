# PREDICTING AIRLINE DELAYS 
 ## WEEK 1 :
 ### STEP 1:
 #### <b>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS :</b>
 <i>
 1.The dataset is uploaded to the <b>SQL server</b>.<br>
 2.It is then accessed by <b>Tableau</b> which is used to analyse the dataset.<br>
 3.The link to the viz is given below :<br></i>

## WEEK 2 :
### STEP 1:
#### <b>PREDICTION OF AIRLINE DELAYS :</b>
<i>
 1.The dataset in the form of csv is imported from the AWS cloud . The dataset as of now contains only 2008's data. (We are trying to include more years to that).<br>
 2.Three outputs are given to the user.<br>
 a) Is the flight delayed or not? - This is predicted using <b>Naive Bayes classification</b> algorithm with a accuracy score of 96%.<br>
   b) How much is the flight delayed at the origin airport and what is the arrival delay? - Predicted using <b>RandomForestRegressor </b>withe r2 score of 99%.<br>
   c) What type of delay is it ? - There are four delays [Carrier delay , Security delay , Weather delay , NAS delay] . This is predicted using <b>RandomForestClassifier</b> with accuracy of 89%.<br>
 d) Deployed the app using Flask on the id : http://ec2-54-69-18-165.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/<br>
 e) Working on the app building on agile basis.

 ## WEEK 3 :
 <i>
 1.The prediction model is deployed on cloud. <br>
 2.The analysis is made with 2 years datasets.
