# PREDICTING AIRLINE DELAYS 
 ## WEEK 1 :
 ### STEP 1:
 #### <b>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS :</b>
 <i>
 1.The dataset is uploaded to the <b>SQL server</b>.<br>
 2.It is then accessed by <b>Tableau</b> which is used to analyse the dataset.<br>
 3.The link to the viz is given below :<br></i>
 <i><b>https://public.tableau.com/shared/WJH6JSS4B?:display_count=yes</b><br></i>
 
 ### STEP 2:
 #### <b>USER INTERFACE USING SHINY :</b>
 <i>
 
 1.The application created will ask the user to input the 'Date' (of travel) , 'Starting'(origin airport) , 'Destination'(destination        airport).<br>
 2.The UI can be published by connecting the Rstudio to <b>Shinyapps.io</b> or <b>Rstudio connect</b>.<br>
 3.Here we are using shinyapps.io to publish the application.<br>
 4.The link to our application is :<b>https://ads-final-project.shinyapps.io/USER-INTERFACE/</b> ( modifications are yet to be made).<br>
 5.Once the user inputs all the necessary data , the user will get the output of the percentage of delay that has happened in the past on    that day for that particular origin and destination.<br></i>

## WEEK 2 :
1. Creating dashboards
2. Predicting the delays usign ML algorithms
